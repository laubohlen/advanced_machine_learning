For this task, we used a gradient boosting classifier to train on extracted features of the ECG signals. As a first approach, we tried training a CNN on spectrograms of the ECG signal data. We standardized the raw signals, zero-padded short signals to a length of 30 seconds and cut the long signals to the same lenght and then performed short time fourier transform. The first few results were promising and we got a score of 84.7 +/- 0.08 on f1. But we couldn't beat the hard baseline on the public set. As a parallel approach we also tried using a 1-D convolutional network. With the 1-D network, we computed different features from the spectrogram over time, such as the centroid, different rolloff frequencies, spectral flatness and statistical moments. The best result from the 1D CNN came from training on the raw data only. 5-fold cross validation scored 70.3 +/- 0.05 on f1. Therefor, we also discarded this approach and started feature engineering. We again used fourier transform to calculate frequency coefficients. We also used the biosppy library to extract heartbeat features from the signal data. We calculated a bunch of statistical features from the extracted data as well as from the raw signals. We then trained classification with SVM, ExtraTrees and GradientBoosting and got the best baseline results using gradient boosting. After some parameter tuning we scored 0.807 (+/- 0.0261) with 5-fold cross validation and 0.81466 on the public set.
