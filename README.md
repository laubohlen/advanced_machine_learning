### Advanced Machine Learning

Lecture at ETH Zurich by Prof. Joachim M. Buhmann, Fall Semester 2020.

#### Course Description ([Website](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/aml/))

> Machine learning algorithms are data analysis methods which search data sets for patterns and characteristic structures. Typical tasks are the classification of data, automatic regression and unsupervised model fitting. Machine learning has emerged mainly from computer science and artificial intelligence, and draws on methods from a variety of related subjects including statistics, applied mathematics and more specialized fields, such as pattern recognition and neural computation. Applications are, for example, image and speech analysis, medical imaging, bioinformatics and exploratory data analysis in natural science and engineering.
