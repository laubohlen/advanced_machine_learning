For the fourth task we used feature extraction, feature selection and a support vector machine classifier to generate a model. Liek in task03 we used the biosppy library to analyse the EEG signals from both channels. The biosppy emg function didn't work to analyse the EMG signal channel. We couldn't fix the issue, so we extracted features from the EMG channel with scipy.signal. From the EEG signal, we extracted various statistical features and the energy, from each of the biosppy outputs (raw signal, filtered signal, the different frequency bands, ...). From the EMG signal, we calculated various statistical features and additional features describing the signal. In total, we generated 52 features from the three channels. We tried a gradient boosting classifier and a random forest classifier but in the end we used a support vector machine classifier. After selecting 29 features and slightly tuning the SVC, we scored a BMAC of 0.9306 (+/- 0.0541) with 5-fold cross validation and 0.914 on the public score.
